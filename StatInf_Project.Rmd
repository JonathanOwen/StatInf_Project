Creating samples
----------------
To examine the relationship between population and sample distribution, 1000 
samples from an exponential distribution with lambda = 0.2 were created with the 
following code.

```{r}
set.seed(050615) 
exp_samples <- data.frame(x = rexp(1000, 0.2))
```  

View the sample distribution
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = exp_samples, aes(x)) + theme_pander() + geom_histogram()
```
